# iText
 ## DESCRIPTION
As a new developer, building this text editor project is immensely helpful for my growth and skill development. Through this task, I'll gain hands-on experience in creating a single-page application that runs in the browser. The project's focus on Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria and data persistence techniques will deepen my understanding of modern web development principles.

By implementing methods to interact with an IndexedDB database using the `idb` package, I'll learn essential data storage and retrieval concepts. Moreover, ensuring offline functionality will enhance my problem-solving skills and make me more versatile as a developer.

Finally, deploying the full-stack application to Heroku will introduce me to the process of launching real-world projects, showcasing my capabilities to potential employers and clients.
